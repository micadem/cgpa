                The university of Ibadan operates a 4-point grading system which is calculated based on  one's 
                performance in each course. This therefore makes it necessary for students to work hard and be 
                focused on their studies.

                <ul>
                    <p> All the courses you're to register for as a student of the university can be classified into three categories which are:
                    </p>
                    <li>Elective</li>
                    <li>Compulsory </li>
                    <li>Required courses</li>

<h6> Forms of Courses </h6>
       

    <div class="long-copy">

       <strong>Compulsory Courses:</strong>   
Courses specified by a department, which a student must take and <strong>PASS.</strong>  
 <br>     
 <br>
<strong> Required Courses </strong>  
       Specified courses within a department which a student must take but not have to necessarily pass.
  <br>
  <br>
 
    <strong>Elective Courses </strong>  
Courses from which a student can/has to choose from in order to make up the required additional units for the award of degree.  <br>
<br>

Strive hard to pass all courses as they all have the same effect as to their Units on your GP.
  
  At the end of first year, a student who passed less than 24 units will be asked to withdraw from the university. Also, the CGPA at the end of each session should not be less than 1.0 else you'll be force to withdraw from the university. 
</div>

<div class="long-copy">
    Here are some terms used in the grading system you need to know as a student
</div>

<div class="long-copy">
    GPA is Grade Point Average and it's the Average of your Grade Point in a 
    particular semester not necessarily the first, second, fifth or last semester. It could be any.
</div>

<div class="long-copy">
    CGPA* is Cumulative Grade Point Average and it's the Total Average of your 
    Grade Point till your present semester/level.
</div>

<div class="long-copy">
    At the end of first year, a student who passed less than 24 units will be asked to withdraw from the university. Also, the CGPA at the end of 
    each session should not be less than 1.0 else you'll be force to withdraw from the university.```

         CGPA range under the 4-point grading scale for classification of degrees:
         <br>
         <br>
         3.5 – 4.00    First Class Honours<br>
         
         3.0 – 3.49     Second Class Honours (Upper Division)<br>

         1.0 – 1.99    Third Class<br>
         <br>
         If you have a minimum score of 70 in all courses in a semester, you'll have a perfect GP for that and 
         if you have nothing less than 70 in all your courses throughout your stay in the university 
         you'll graduate with a perfect CGPA, a handful number of students have done that, you can also do it
