Your result will be graded on a 4-point system. Although, on this grading system, you'll have to put extra  
effort to be on first class, if you work very hard and God helping you, you can even graduate with as perfect 
CGPA an exact 4.0. The pass mark for any course is 45%. If one scores between 0 - 44% in a course,  
he/she is considered to have failed the course which I pray will never be your portion. </p>

<h6><strong>Forms of Courses</strong></h6>
       <p  class="long-copy">All courses borrowed outside your department acquire the status <strong>ELECTIVE</strong>  while your departmental courses are either <strong>COMPULSORY</strong> or <strong>REQUIRED</strong>. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="long-copy">

       <strong>Compulsory Courses:</strong>   
Courses specified by a department, which a student must take and <strong>PASS.</strong>  
 <br>     
 <br>
<strong> Required Courses: </strong>  
       Specified courses within a department which a student must take but not have to necessarily pass.
  <br>
  <br>
 
    <strong>Elective Courses: </strong>  
Courses from which a student can/has to choose from in order to make up the required additional units for the award of degree.  <br>
<br>

Strive hard to pass all courses as they all have the same effect as to their Units on your GP.
  
  At the end of first year, a student who passed less than 24 units will be asked to withdraw from the university. Also, the CGPA at the end of each session should not be less than 1.0 else you'll be force to withdraw from the university.

            If you have a minimum score of 70 in all courses in a semester, you'll have a perfect GP for that and 
            if you have nothing less than 70 in all your courses throughout your stay in the university 
            you'll graduate with a perfect CGPA, a handful number of students have done that, you can also do it.
